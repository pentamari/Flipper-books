# Flipper Books

An EPUB reader for the Flipper Zero.

Load `.epub` files from your phone or computer onto the SD card, then read them
on the device with bookmarks, table of contents, search, night mode,
auto-scroll, and battery-friendly power modes.

## Features

### Format
- **fbook2 format** with cover thumbnail, per-chapter word counts, language
  metadata, longer chapter titles (48 chars), images up to 128x64, and
  separate per-image format byte for future grayscale support. The reader
  accepts both v1 and v2; the converter emits v2 by default (`--v1` for
  legacy).
- Defensive file validation rejects malformed `.fbook` records whose text,
  image, or cover ranges do not fit inside the file.
- EPUB support via the Python converter.
- `.txt` support directly on device.

### Library
- **Cover thumbnails** in a custom library view with **inline progress bars**
  next to each title.
- **Wrap-around scrolling**: Up/Down loops from first to last entry.
- **Sort modes**: Name / Recent / Progress / Favorites first.
- **Favorite toggle** per book, displayed as a star next to the cover.
- **Mark Finished** (manual or auto when reaching the end).

### Reader
- Word-wrap pagination, resume-from-last-page.
- **Text size** (Tiny / Small / Medium / Large).
- **Line spacing** (Tight / Normal / Loose / Double).
- **Font family** (Auto / Serif / Sans).
- **Margin** (None / Normal / Wide).
- **Page number / percentage overlay** (top-right).
- **Working slide & fade animations** that show both old and new page during
  the transition.
- **Night mode** (true black background with white text).
- **Toggleable images** (1bpp, LSB-first XBM order so they render correctly).
- **Chapter prev/next** on long-press Left / Right.
- **Sleep timer** (5/10/15/30/60 min, returns to library on expiry).
- **Auto-scroll** with adjustable speed.
- **Bookmarks** (up to 8 per book).
- **Table of Contents** with chapter titles and page numbers.
- **Full-text search** with "search next".
- **Go to %...** picker (0-100%).
- Justify / hyphenation toggles.
- Vibrate on page turn.

### Stats
- **Reading speed** (words/minute) computed from accumulated reading time.
- **Estimated time remaining** for the current book based on WPM and the
  unread word count.
- Total time read, pages read, books opened, books finished.

Per-book progress is saved automatically on every page turn and on exit.
When leaving the reader, the app saves once and detaches the active book from
the reader view before freeing it, so timers cannot observe stale book state.

## Loading books

1. Connect the Flipper to your computer or use qFlipper / the mobile app.
2. Copy your book into `/ext/apps_data/books/library/`.
3. Either:
   - Drop a `.epub` file in, **after** running the converter once (the device
     keeps the converted sidecar in `/ext/apps_data/books/cache/`), or
   - Run `python3 tools/epub_to_fbook.py my-book.epub` on your computer and
     copy the resulting `.fbook` onto the Flipper's `apps_data/books/library`.
   - Or drop a plain `.txt` file (no conversion needed).

## Converter

```bash
# Requires Python 3.8+ and Pillow for image support
pip install Pillow
python3 tools/epub_to_fbook.py my-book.epub -o my-book.fbook
```

Flags:

- `--no-images` - skip image extraction (smaller files, faster conversion).
- `--v1` - emit legacy v1 `.fbook` output.
- `-o PATH` - custom output path.

The converter limits oversized EPUB XML, HTML, image, cover, and extracted
text members before reading them into memory.

### Regenerating older .fbook files

If you have `.fbook` files made before this version of the converter
they may be empty (text body length = 0) or have images packed in the
wrong byte order. Re-run the converter on the original `.epub` and
delete the stale entries from `/ext/apps_data/books/cache/` so the
new copies are used.

## Building

Uses [ufbt](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt) with the
Momentum SDK:

```bash
pip install ufbt
ufbt update --index-url=https://up.momentum-fw.dev/firmware/directory.json --channel=release
ufbt
```

The built `.fap` lands in `dist/`.

## CI

A single GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`)
builds the FAP on every push and publishes a GitHub Release whenever a tag
starting with `v` is pushed (or manually via the `workflow_dispatch` input).
